# RISC-V Single-Core Processor

> Because sometimes buying a processor is too easy â€” so I built one from scratch in Verilog.

A single-cycle **RISC-V RV32I** processor implemented in Verilog.  
Designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of processor architecture â€” from instruction fetch to write-back â€” in a clean, modular HDL implementation.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Implements the **RV32I** base integer instruction set
- **Single-cycle architecture**: one instruction executed per clock cycle
- Modular design: ALU, Control Unit, Register File, Memory units, and supporting modules
- Verified using dedicated **testbenches** for each core component and the top-level design

## ðŸ§  Architecture Overview
The CPU follows the classic single-cycle datapath:

1. **Instruction Fetch** â€“ Retrieve the instruction from memory  
2. **Decode** â€“ Interpret the instruction and identify required operations  
3. **Execute** â€“ Perform arithmetic, logic, or address calculation via the ALU  
4. **Memory Access** â€“ Load or store data if required  
5. **Write Back** â€“ Save results to the register file  

This flow is completed within **a single clock cycle**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Enhancements
- Extend to a **5-stage pipelined architecture** for improved throughput
- Implement the **RV32M** extension for multiplication/division support
- Synthesize and deploy on FPGA hardware for real-world testing
